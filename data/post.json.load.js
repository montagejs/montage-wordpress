Found only in northeastern Kenya and southwest Somalia, the hirola is a critically endangered species of antelope. Hirola are not in zoos so you won&#8217;t see one here on grounds, but you can visit and even <a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org/education/giraffe-encounter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a special face-to-face encounter with giraffes</a> here at the zoo, who are neighbors to the hirola in the wild! Both of these species are currently being protected in the wild through your visit to the zoo, with a portion of your admission fee supporting the work of our friends at the <a href="https://www.hirolaconservation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hirola Conservation Program (HCP)</a> in Kenya.</p>\n<p>The Hirola Conservation Program aims to save hirola in Kenya through scientific research, habitat restoration, and strengthening community-based conservation and education efforts. Like many of our partners, the team at the HCP know that there is power in community when it comes to saving wildlife, and as a result, their focus is not just on the hirola &#8211; it is on the people that live alongside them. For example, while speaking and writing in Arabic is easy for most locals along the Kenya-Somalia border, reading and writing in English is an ongoing challenge since learning how to raise and take care of livestock takes priority over a more formal education. Realizing that this makes it difficult for younger generations to become involved in alternative livelihoods like science and conservation, the HCP has created adult literacy classes for their ranger staff. By providing rangers with this training, doors will open for community members as new knowledge is shared, representing a unique opportunity towards improving citizen science. In December, rangers were also taken on a camping trip where they learned more about shelter building, wildlife tracking, and foraging. This training not only helped to build ranger skill sets, but also served to enhance team work and give the rangers the opportunity to get to know one another better.</p>\n<p>The HCP serves as an important resource for many members of the community, and as a result, was the go-to for advice when locals began to run into trouble with giraffes. With recent draught conditions, the local communities have moved their farms closer to water ways in areas that overlap with the paths that giraffes take to drink.  This move made it impossible for giraffes to reach their water source without trampling local community’s food sources. To help reduce mounting tensions, the HCP began work to revitalize the Garissa Giraffe Sanctuary, located near communities experiencing conflict with giraffes. In 2017, the team at HCP was able to restore old watering troughs and provide new sources of water for giraffes in the area, while also creating giraffe awareness in 5 surrounding villages. Through raising awareness and working directly with members of the community, the team in Kenya hopes to generate renewed levels of enthusiasm among locals, government agencies, and the international conservation community, which in turn, will help to protect species like the hirola and giraffe for years to come.</p>\n<p>We are amazed by how much our family in Kenya were able to accomplish in 2017, and we can&#8217;t wait to see all of the amazing things they are able to do in the new year. We&#8217;d like to thank all of our guests for supporting projects like this one through the purchase of your admission ticket here at the Houston Zoo. Two of our team members will be traveling to Kenya this year to help produce a documentary on the hirola for the HCP, so stay tuned &#8211; exciting updates are headed your way!</p>\n',"protected":!1},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>Have you heard of the hirola?

Use floss?  I did!  What do you do with that toothbrush when you get a new one?</p>\n<p>We all need toothbrushes but, they cannot be recycled with general recyclables. Over 1 BILLION toothbrushes are thrown away in the US every year!     Here is the good news, the Houston Zoo is offering you an alternative to just throwing it away.  You can now recycle toothbrushes, toothpaste tubes, floss containers and toothbrush packaging at the zoo.</p>\n<p>Colgate has partnered with Terrracycle to offer a program to turn these objects into school supplies for the Kids in Need Foundation! The items they collect are used to make bags, folders and other supplies.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Zoo recently collected items like these from staff for a “Plastic Free July Challenge”. They collected 31 toothpaste tubes, 6 empty toothbrush packages, 4 floss containers and 50 toothbrushes.  That came to 2.5 pounds of plastic that didn’t go to the landfill!  If the Zoo Staff can collect that much in just one month, just think about the impact we could have if we ALL recycle our toothbrushes and dental hygiene items.</p>\n<p>Even better news, there is an added bonus. If you bring your items to the Naturally Wild Swap Shop, you will get points to spend in the shop!  It is suggested that you replace your toothbrush every 3 months, so if you are due for a new one this month the timing is perfect!  You can drop off your items in the designated recycle bin in the Swap Shop.  Please cut toothpaste tubes down the side with scissors and rinse out any toothpaste residue prior to bringing them in.  (please note that electric toothbrushes and battery toothbrushes are not recyclable with this program)</p>\n<p>Another way to help keep this extra plastic out of the trash is to buy an eco-friendly toothbrush, such as the “Humble Brush” or another bamboo toothbrush which can be found online at humblesmile.org or Amazon.com.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know about the Naturally Wild Swap Shop?  Click <a href="http://www.houstonzoo.org/plan-your-visit/activities/">here</a> for more information.</p>\n',"protected":!1},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>Did you brush your teeth this morning?

While most would be sleeping, the van was full of excited chatter as the team neared its destination – the 22<sup>nd</sup> annual Whooping Crane Festival! The festival celebrates the yearly return of the whooping cranes to their wintering habitat. Due to Hurricane Harvey, the International Crane Foundation wasn’t sure if the festival would take place this year, but knowing how important this festival is for both the birds and the community, several local partners including the Houston Zoo were able to lend a helping hand to make sure it happened!</p>\n<p>Weighing around 15 pounds, the whooping crane has a wingspan of more than 7 feet and is as tall as many humans, reaching a height of around 5 feet, making it the tallest bird in North America! Whooping cranes are best known for their courtship dance, finding mating partners through an elaborate display of kicking, head-pumping, and wing-sweeping. Adult whooping cranes can be spotted fairly easily thanks to their bright white feathers and accents of crimson red on the top of their head. This section of the Texas coast is the only place where you can see the world’s last naturally-occurring population of Whooping Cranes.</p>\n<p>At the festival, zoo staff got to spend the day with Corinna Holfus, the new Whooping Crane Outreach Coordinator whose position is being funded by the Houston Zoo. Corinna, a Houston native, was well aware of the post-Harvey struggles Port Aransas was facing when she joined the team in October of 2017. She didn’t always plan on working with Texas species, but when the opportunity arose she recalled how excited she was at the prospect of becoming a “craniac” – a designation shared among crane lovers within the birding community. Since landing the job, Holfus has been working with hunters, landowners, and other members of the community to develop awareness and caring for whooping cranes with the hope of fostering their commitment to safe guard these unique birds. You might think that saving wildlife is the last thing people want to add to their plates when recovering from a natural disaster, but Holfus has found the community’s response to be nothing short of inspiring. “With everything that has been happening here, the whooping cranes have actually become a symbol of hope for the community. So many things feel out of your control, but people realize that they can do something to help these birds, and they have started to rally around them which has been really special to watch.”</p>\n<p>While the storm negatively impacted human communities, it actually did a lot to help clean debris and pollution out of whooping crane habitat, which in turn led to an increase in the amount of available food sources. This has ultimately led to some pretty impressive numbers of cranes spending the winter in Port Aransas, with the number reaching a record high of around 431 birds last year. On our day out on the water we saw over 50 whooping cranes – this may not seem like much, but for people like Houston Zoo veterinarian Dr. Joe Flanagan who has been traveling to view the whooping cranes for many years it is quite an exciting turn out. “Back in the 80s to see 50 birds would have meant you had seen the entire remaining population”, he told us while looking eagerly through his binoculars.  One of the rarest birds in North America, the whooping crane saw its numbers drop to just 15 in the early 1940s, but with the help of land protection and public education, their numbers have continued to steadily increase, with an estimated population of 757 world-wide.</p>\n<p>We are so proud to be involved in this work to help save a very unique community of Texans, and thanks to the continued support of Zoo goers like you, this native species has an even better chance for a bright future.

These vital training sessions are made possible through a portion of your admission ticket going towards supporting partners like Murthy, who are hard at work all around the globe to save wildlife.</p>\n<p>Murthy works in the Eastern Ghats, located in Southern India, to improve relationships between humans and snakes, and build local community support for snake conservation. Fear and lack of knowledge about snakes has led to a rise in the killing of many snake species, including the king cobra. Murthy and his team are working to transform the fear of snakes into a respect and appreciation for the important role that snakes play in the ecosystem. Snakes are an important species to control rodent populations that spread deadly diseases.</p>\n<figure style="max-width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_6825-270x203.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Murthy meets with guests during a keeper chat at the reptile house</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While in town, Murthy was able to spend a great deal of time with the herpetology team, learning more about husbandry for snakes and reptiles. Simply put, husbandry refers to the handling and care of different species. This is an important skill to have when working with any animal, and good husbandry skills are essential when handling venomous snakes. Murthy and the team were also able to brainstorm ideas on building local community support for snake conservation; a priority for Murthy&#8217;s project and something our herpetology team strives to do for snake species native to Texas.</p>\n<figure style="max-width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27067213_10155876232810560_80084059919629467_n-270x203.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Murthy makes friends with the conservation education team&#8217;s resident snake</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Murthy also had the opportunity to talk with guests during keeper chats at the reptile house, as well as presenting his work to zoo staff and meeting with the conservation education team where he discovered their resident snake! Getting to spend time within all different sections of the zoo was extremely important to Murthy, and he is very excited to take what he learned here back to India: &#8220;The exposure visits for conservation partners are incredibly useful not only to exchange information, but also better understand the role of zoos in conservation. It will benefit our field projects as well through interactions with various sections in the zoo and tailoring those learnings to apply in local conditions back home.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to meet Murthy, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; Fox 26 came to interview him and the herpetology team!

Upon arrival you meet with your travel partner and guide and embark on an 8 mile hike into the mountains where you will spend the night at a farmers house. You wake with the sun the next morning, listening to the call of howler monkeys as you climb out of your hammock and prepare yourself for a day of hiking. For the next two weeks, your days are full of trekking through the mountains, talking to locals, and setting up camera traps. What are you in search of? A rare and elusive bird – the blue-billed curassow.</p>\n<p>This is the exact journey our assistant bird curator Chris Holmes has recently returned from. Chris has been directly involved in blue-billed conservation both in the US and Colombia since joining the Houston Zoo full-time in 2000. Unique to Colombia, there are only a few hundred blue-billed curassows left in the wild due to habitat destruction and hunting. Currently, the only known location of this bird is within a reserve in the southern portion of its range and little research has been done in the northern half, leaving a huge gap in the knowledge base about this species. Chris, who serves as the American Zoos and Aquariums regional program population manager for the species and Christian Olaciregui, the Colombian population manager for blue-billed curassows and head of biology and conservation at Barranquilla Zoo, hope to close this gap by exploring this area of Colombia that has been historically inaccessible. As fate would have it, <a href="http://www.proyectotiti.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proyecto Tití</a>, a Houston Zoo partner working with cotton-top tamarin monkeys just happens to be situated in the Montes de Maria region of Colombia – an area where the blue-billed curassow is believed to live but has been rarely seen. Knowing if these birds are in the area will help to strengthen conservation efforts for this critically-endangered bird species, and will inform next steps as plans for the future are discussed.</p>\n<p>Chris&#8217;s time in Colombia was not just focused on seeking out blue-billed curassow tracks and setting up camera traps in an attempt to locate the birds &#8211; he and Christian also spent a great deal of time talking with local organizations and land owners as they are playing a huge role in leading conservation efforts in the study area. As Chris explains it: &#8220;On day two, we walked out of the forest along the riverbed to go back to the City of San Juan as there was a meeting of the Regional Protected Areas System which included, The Colombian Environmental Authority, Proyecto Titi, other regional NGOs, and local farmers to discuss the projects they are working on together.This meeting illustrated the massive amount of work and dedication that is going on in this region. There is a lot of work being put into connecting the National Park through-out this area via a system of corridors, to ensure that there are not any patches of forest that are isolated by cattle farming or agricultural activities. All of these groups have seen successes in having private land owners set aside plots of their private property to remain, or be developed into corridors to connect habitat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The fact that these efforts are already underway in the region is excellent, and will be particularly important should the camera traps provide evidence of blue-billed curassows in the area. Christian and the team in Colombia will continue to check the traps periodically to see what images are recovered, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what they find! While we await the results, make sure to drop by and check out the wattled curassow, an endangered relative of the blue-billed curassow, on your next trip to the zoo and come face-to-face with one of the many species you are helping to save in the wild!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',

In September of 2011, a friend of mine called to tell me about Pewtunia the Corpse flower at the Houston Zoo. I immediately went down there to see her and became a member of the Zoo that day! I try to get to the Zoo every member morning as my schedule allows. I am a freelance artist and calligrapher and love taking pictures for my own pleasure and to incorporate in my drawings.

I try to always see the Cats (I have 3 house cats of my own) and was sad when Jonathan died, but he had a good life. After December’s Member morning, I have now put the Elephants on my regular walk. I can’t wait to see their new environment. I am a great fan of Dinosaurs and was thrilled by the Dinosaur exhibit I went twice. Each month I try to see either the Reptile house, Birds, Bugs, Aquarium and Natural Encounters. There is so much to see and learn about I never get tired of going and appreciate the extra perks like Photo day and the Horticultural tour!&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>From all of us here at the Houston Zoo, we want to say thank you to Karla and all of our Zoo Members.

Abandoned traps can also pose a threat to other wildlife like otters and diamondback terrapins, causing them harm. Fishing gear that is lost, dumped, or abandoned is sometimes referred to as &#8220;ghost fishing&#8221; because this gear can continue to catch aquatic species even though it has been left unattended.  While these accidental catches have a clearly negative impact on the health of wildlife, they can also cause problems for the commercial fishing industry. Each animal that is caught in an abandoned trap is one less that can be caught in a sustainable and ocean-friendly manner. This means that more individuals must be caught to meet the demands of the seafood market, and as a result there are less animals in the ocean working to keep it and species populations healthy.  How do we help to solve this problem? The answer is quite simple &#8211; every February, the community is invited to participate in removing these old traps from the water to protect wildlife!</p>\n<p>While some volunteers go out on boats to collect traps, others stay behind to collect trash along the shore. All kinds of trash and recycling are collected &#8211; everything from bottles and cans to plastic straws and fishing line; sometimes even things like car tires! Removing debris from the shore is equally important, as it protects species like sea turtles and pelicans from ingesting trash or becoming entangled in line. Once boaters return with traps, they are unloaded and inspected for trapped wildlife.

Our department is quiet and not the first thing most people think of when they think of a zoo job. Most days we work early hours and behind the scenes to keep the zoo beautiful. Many people don’t realize how many different skill sets are part of the field of zoo horticulture. On staff, we have an arborist, tree climbers, a green house manager, color beds creatives, heavy machinery operators, a plant registrar, irrigation specialists, and browse specialists.</p>\n<p>Browse is a form of enrichment that most of our animals receive several days a week. Browse includes edible nontoxic plants and flowers that are grown on zoo grounds and provide additional nutrition and enrichment for the animals. The idea for a browse bouquet class came to us after our browse specialist Maria showed off her flower arrangement skills for a special event. We realized people would love to see bouquets the animals can eat and play with. We presented the idea to Nicholas in the Conservation Education Department and he was extremely receptive.</p>\n<p>Recently we had the opportunity to hold a couple of Browse Bouquet classes for zoo camp kids as part of our partnership with the education department. In these classes, we had groups of kids and counselors make flower arrangements using hibiscus flowers, banana leaves, orange kumquats, and many other approved browse plants, all cut from plants we grow here at the zoo. This was a fun and interactive way to teach campers the importance of plants and how they directly affect the animals we take care of here at the zoo. After completing their bouquets, we visited the Asian elephant family where the keepers held a short presentation for us.  The keepers called over the elephant family group to get a snack and the elephants greatly enjoyed it. The children stood there in awe watching as these beautiful giants ate something they had helped create!</p>\n<p>The bouquets were a success. The kids were able to pick the flowers they wanted to use and help gather other leaves for the bouquet.  The memorable moment was of course getting to interact with the elephants. We plan to continue these classes and expand upon them with other interactive activities. Hopefully this will translate well with older teens and even adults. The Houston Zoo Camp and Zoo Crew programs help lots of young people learn about the different careers paths that exist in a zoo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',"protected":!1},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>The following post was written by Jesus Campos, a Horticulture Team Lead at the Houston Zoo.  The horticulture department is constantly trying to find new and interactive ways to educate the public about nature and the important role plants play.

The month of February is when The National Audubon Society does their Great Backyard Bird Count. This count helps researchers at the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> and the <a href="http://www.audubon.org/">National Audubon Society</a> learn more about how birds are doing, and how to protect them and the environment. A bunch of us at the Zoo love to go out on our time and bird watch. So, we thought it would be fun to give you some bird watching tips.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find a good <a href="http://www.audubon.org/news/what-bird-guide-best-you">field guide</a>. The ones we like here, are Sibley’s Guide to Birds and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Field-America-Edition/dp/1426208286">National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peterson-Field-Guide-America-Guides/dp/0618966145/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423623248&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=peterson+field+guide+to+birds">Peterson Field Guide to the Birds of North America</a> is a classic. But if you want photograph’s instead of drawings, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/stokes-field-guide-america-guides/dp/0316010502">The Stokes Field Guide to the Birds of North America</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kaufman-Field-Guide-Birds-America/dp/0618574239/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423620582&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kaufman+guide">Kaufman Field Guide to the Birds of North Americ</a>a are the way to go. There are also some great field guide apps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2. Get a decent pair of binoculars. For birding you want a magnification of 8 or 10. So look for a pair that says it is 8&#215;42 or 10&#215;42, for example. Binoculars fit everybody’s eyes differently, so head to a sporting goods store and try a few out. They also come in a large price range, but there are some good, inexpensive ones out there. And don’t forget that strap!</p>\n<ol start="3">\n<li>Find out what to expect to find. If you are going to a park (and Texas has some awesome state and local parks) see if they have a checklist. Some of them have them online and some you can pick up at the ranger offices. These checklists will tell what you may see while visiting a park. They are usually categorized by time of year you may see the bird and how common they are.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are also some websites that tell you birds you can find in your area if you are doing some backyard or roadside birding.</p>\n<ol start="4">\n<li>Learn the four-step of identification. What is the bird’s size and shape; what its main color pattern; take note of its behavior; and factor in what habitat it’s in. Do a little research on where the birds will be. Are they going to be in the tree tops, on the ground, or in the water for example. The internet and your field guide should be able to help with this. Don’t want to be wasting your time looking for an arboreal dwelling bird if you are in scrublands or a duck in the desert.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>5. Find a birding group. Your local <a href="https://houstonaudubon.org/birding/gallery/index.html">Audubon </a>website, can let you know if there are groups or trips in your area. Like us here at the zoo, birders love to talk about birds.</p>\n<ol start="6">\n<li>Record your sightings. Buy a diary to help you keep track of what and where you have seen birds. There are so many birds, it is easy to forget what you have seen. There are also apps for that. The <a href="https://ebird.org/home">Ebird</a> app is a great one and you can use it to let other birders know what you have seen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org/blog/welcome-year-bird/attachment/ducks-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-58889"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-58889" src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ducks-620x555.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="555" srcset="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ducks-620x555.jpg 620w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ducks-341x305.jpg 341w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ducks-270x242.jpg 270w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ducks-768x687.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>\n<p>Houston is a wonderful place for birding because we are on the migratory bird route. You can see many varied species in the area. We took a thirty-minute walk just around Herman park a few days ago and saw 17 different species. From water birds like Ring- billed ducks, Pie – billed grebes, Gadwalls, American coots, Black- bellied whistling ducks and both Double crested and Neo tropic cormorants, to Robins, Yellow – rumped warblers, Pine warblers, Cardinals and Blue Jays.  We even saw a juvenile Bald eagle flying with a Red – tailed Hawk.</p>\n<p>So, get out there, enjoy nature, and go birding!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',"protected":!1},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>Written by Jessica Clark We here at the Houston Zoo are very excited to be participating in monthly events to get the word out on how important and cool birds are.

One way we are achieving that goal is by forming lasting partnerships with school groups in and around the Houston area.  These partnerships all look a bit different from one another, but they all have one thing in common: they are inspiring students, teachers and communities to take action to save wildlife!  Ridgecrest Elementary is an example of one school that is partnering with the Houston Zoo to save pollinators through our Pollinator Partnerships.</p>\n<p>The partnership between Ridgecrest Elementary and the Houston Zoo started when Ms. Lindsey Duke came to one of our Educator Events. “It all started when I attend my first Educator’s Night Out at the Houston Zoo.  I was so intrigued at what I experienced there and I knew that I wanted my students to experience the same” stated Ms. Duke.  During the event, she learned more about the importance of pollinators, the threats they are facing, and how her students can help.  She decided to reach out to DeAndra Ramsey from the Houston Zoo and start the process of forming a partnership centered around helping pollinators.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Monarch_Butterfly-00131.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-35152 size-full" src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Monarch_Butterfly-00131.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" srcset="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Monarch_Butterfly-00131.jpg 550w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Monarch_Butterfly-00131-406x305.jpg 406w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>\n<p>“Teaching kindergarten at a new campus I was a little nervous at how the initial pitch of the partnership and garden project would go but it was received with full support from administration and staff. We selected a spot on our campus that had once been a garden but had a lot of potential to be transformed into a pollinator garden”, says Ms. Duke.   In addition to picking the place for the garden and choosing the native plants that will be planted, the students have been learning about how a healthy pollinator population is vital to a healthy ecosystem.  Ambassador animals that are native to this area of Texas have been brought to the campus so that the students can see first-hand the animals they are helping with their work in the garden.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_58799" style="max-width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9980.jpg"><img class="wp-image-58799 size-large" src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9980-620x465.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" srcset="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9980-620x465.jpg 620w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9980-407x305.jpg 407w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9980-270x203.jpg 270w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9980-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Families came together to work in the pollinator garden during the first Ridgecrest Elementary Garden Day</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But it doesn’t stop in the classroom! “My goal was to make this not only a school wide project but also a community/family project.  So we had our first Ridgecrest Elementary Garden Day.  We invited families and community members out to our campus one Saturday and together we weeded and prepared our garden area.  I was blown away but the participation this event received.  To see so many families working together was amazing”, says Ms. Duke.  The Houston Zoo was able to attend the family gardening day and work side-by-side with the students and their families to transform this space into a wonderful pollinator habitat.  Starting a pollinator garden has multiple benefits, including connecting children to nature.  Preparing the space allowed families to get up close and person with a variety of Texas native wildlife such as frogs, snakes, and lizards.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_58800" style="max-width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0019.jpg"><img class="wp-image-58800 size-large" src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0019-450x600.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" srcset="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0019-450x600.jpg 450w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0019-229x305.jpg 229w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0019-270x360.jpg 270w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0019-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Students were able to get up close and personal with some native Texas wildlife while working in the garden.

They are taking action to save wildlife in their very own back yards and becoming wildlife heroes.  “None of this would be possible without our Partnership with DeAndra and the Houston Zoo.  Our students have had so many opportunities already in the first year of this partnership.  They have had ambassador animals come to the school and they have begun to learn about conservation of resources and species.  To hear them randomly throughout the day talking about things connected to our project is so encouraging”, says Ms. Duke.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_58803" style="max-width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891.jpg"><img class="wp-image-58803 size-large" src="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891-620x465.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" srcset="https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891-620x465.jpg 620w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891-407x305.jpg 407w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891-270x203.jpg 270w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.houstonzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_02891.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A few of the families that took action to save pollinators during the Ridgecrest Elementary Gardening Day.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ridgecrest Elementary has been a shining example of a school that is taking action to save wildlife.
